BUG:
When running without --debug, it appears that the script doesn't execute all the way through
The result is that execution LOOKS okay, but rekeyed.kdbx never gets created

Seems the "eval" command on line 375 is not getting executed whenever debug is off
NO IDEA why.
Commenting out line 374 does not fix
